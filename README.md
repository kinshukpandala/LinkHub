# LinkHub 🚀  
**A Personal LinkTree Replica – But Better!**

---

## 📌 About  
**LinkHub** is my custom-built alternative to Linktree. After Linktree introduced some changes that affected the user experience when people clicked on my links (see the screenshot below), I decided to take control and build my own version—cleaner, faster, and entirely *mine*.

## 🛠️ What I've Built  
The current version of **LinkHub** is live and functional! Here's a sneak peek of how it looks right now:

I'm pretty excited about how it's coming together, but this is just the beginning. More improvements are on the way!

## 🔮 What's Next  
I'm planning to:
- Add more customization options (themes, colors)
- Optimize for mobile even more
- Add analytics to track link clicks
- Maybe even turn it into a simple template others can use!
